# rusttak
A Rust Implementation of TakServer

Currently - this readme helps setup and configure a Centralized TAK Server.


To set up an FTS Server, which is the fully featured federated TAK server. Follow the following steps.

There are two gotchas. 

1. python3 must resolve to python3.8.10 via aliasing or symlinking. The install script for installing the server assumes it can do a "python3 -m pip install and it install libraries relevant to Python3.8.
2. ports must be created in the firewall for the following services.
3. API =
4. SSL =
5. TCP = 
6. Webserver = 
7. 

# Instructions for ensuring that you have Python3.8 on a brand new Ubuntu 20.04 server.

first we will ensure that when the freetakserver script called python3 it resolves to python3.8. I intend to use pyenv in the future or docker.

sudo rm -f Python-3.8.10.tgz
cd Python-3.8.10
sudo ./configure --enable-optimizations
sudo make altinstall
python3.8 -V

sudo nano ~/.bashrc
alias python3.8=python3

# run install script for FreeTakServer. 

This script will install all sorts of components like nodered and murmur that we may not want later but I don't have any reason to exclude these components presently.
